# TermiRust

Native desktop SSH client built with `gpui`, `gpui-component`, `russh`, and `vt100`.

## Current product shape

- Host library UI inspired by Terminus-style launchers, with groups, tags, vaults, batch selection, and bulk actions.
- Workflow navigation surfaces Activity, Projects, Connections, Sessions, Files / Artifacts,
  Devices, and Settings as primary destinations; specialized presets, vaults, keys,
  snippets, known hosts, and logs remain available as advanced tools.
- Sessions presents the authoritative active or archived typed Session library across
  all Projects and both app-attached and durable ownership routes, with Project, preset,
  and ownership context on each row.
- Files / Artifacts separates live local/SFTP browsing from the bounded Session artifact
  repository. Its artifact index spans authoritative Sessions and shows Project, Session,
  preset, state, type, size, and truthful import provenance before reusing the existing
  preview, export, quarantine, restore, and purge actions.
- Single-row top chrome with custom in-app traffic lights (close / minimize / zoom); the macOS OS title-bar drag is taken over so the chrome stays draggable from its empty area.
- Draggable workspace tabs that scroll horizontally when they overflow; double-click a tab to rename it; right-click a tab for Duplicate / Duplicate in a new window / Rename / Split / Close.
- Each workspace tab can contain split panes arranged as a recursive binary tree: dropping a tab onto a pane splits that pane, with arbitrary nesting and resizable dividers.
- Each pane is its own SSH session and PTY; a native local terminal can also be opened and behaves like any other pane.
- Quick connect: type `user@host` or `ssh user@host:port` in the search bar.
- Reconnect button on disconnected/errored panes; optional automatic reconnect after non-user-initiated SSH drops, configurable in Settings.
- Configurable SSH keep-alive ping interval to keep idle sessions alive across NAT/load-balancer timeouts.
- Per-host SFTP remote-files view (browse, upload, download, delete) available from any workspace.
- Per-host port-forwarding rules (local, remote reverse, dynamic SOCKS) that start automatically on connect.
- Per-host jump-host chains.
- Saved snippets plus a per-workspace command palette for snippets, recent commands, and built-in tasks.
- Snippet commands accept {{HOST}}, {{USER}}, {{PORT}}, {{TITLE}}, {{ADDRESS}} placeholders that expand against the active pane on send.
- Per-host color tag, environment variables, description/notes, startup directory, and startup command.
- Right-click context menu on terminal panes; per-pane Clear and Duplicate; Detach moves a pane into its own workspace tab.
- Multi-line clipboard pastes are held behind a confirmation banner by default to prevent accidental script execution.
- Per-workspace Broadcast Input toggle that fans typed/pasted bytes out to every connected pane.
- Window size and position — including which monitor — persist across launches.
- Bounded local diagnostics store only allowlisted operational metadata; raw terminal content, stderr, panic text, and backtraces are excluded. Users can preview an exact privacy-scanned bundle before saving it locally.
- Encrypted-vault shared-folder sync through Dropbox / iCloud Drive / Google Drive / Syncthing, plus portable and passphrase-encrypted JSON export/import.
- Keyboard shortcuts: Cmd+D / Cmd+Shift+B / Cmd+Shift+L / Cmd+Alt+arrow, library/section switching, search focus, and new-host flow.
- Terminal surface supports:
  - raw VT rendering, PTY resize, local scrollback, terminal search
  - text selection and clipboard copy, optional copy-on-select for mouse selections
  - clipboard paste with bracketed paste when requested
  - xterm mouse reporting for terminal apps that enable it
  - configurable terminal font size and font family
- Persistent session history with timestamps and duration in the Logs view; host cards surface a relative "Last connected" badge.
- Per-workspace Split or Agent Canvas layout. Canvas mode places existing local
  and SSH terminals, interactive or structured coding agents, sticky notes, and
  group frames in persisted, draggable, resizable nodes with reviewed context
  links and bounded dependency orchestration.
- Paired mobile controllers can list, watch, and type into tmux sessions the app did not
  create when "Show tmux sessions" is on (LAN route). Devices also offers a previewed,
  reversible shell startup change that starts new Terminal, Zed, iTerm2, Ghostty, WezTerm,
  and VS Code terminal tabs inside tmux. See `docs/remote-terminals.md`.
- Saved host groups can open directly as SSH Fleet canvases. The fleet panel
  summarizes connection and tmux state and provides guarded reconnect,
  broadcast-input, and disconnect controls without removing canvas nodes.
- Local Codex, Claude Code, and Gemini structured jobs normalize provider events;
  interactive remote agents reuse saved SSH and tmux settings.
- Write-capable local coding agents default to app-managed Git worktrees with
  conservative status inspection and clean-only removal.
- Settings view for appearance theme, terminal font, default local shell, workspace restore, history limits, and import/export.
- TOFU known-host pinning; Known Hosts view supports deleting pinned host keys.
- Keychain view shows imported key type, public key availability, and an "Add Key File" picker.
- Build/distribution metadata for cargo-bundle (macOS .app, Linux deb/rpm) lives in `crates/termirust-desktop/Cargo.toml`; per-platform release flow is in `docs/building.md`.

## Explicitly out of scope right now

- drag-reordering split panes
- remote team / multiplayer features (shared-folder vault sync is the only sync that exists)

## Repository layout

- Root `Cargo.toml` is a virtual workspace manifest; `default-members` points at
  `crates/termirust-desktop` (package name `termirust`), so plain `cargo run` /
  `cargo check` / `cargo test` from the root target the desktop app. Use `--workspace`
  for every crate. Shared version and `rust-version` live in `[workspace.package]`.
- `crates/` holds every workspace member, including the desktop app, CLI, TUI, MCP,
  relay, session host, mobile FFI, and contract crates.
- `apps/ios` (Swift) and `apps/android` (Kotlin) are the native mobile applications;
  their FFI libraries are built by `scripts/build/` and copied in by `scripts/sync/`.
- `tests/` is shared cross-crate test material only: `fixtures/`, the `support/`
  module included via `#[path]`, `ui/` audit inventories, and `swift/` runners.
  Rust integration tests live inside each crate.
- `scripts/` is grouped by verb: `verify/`, `test/`, `build/`, `sync/`, `bench/`,
  `run/`, `dev/`. Every script resolves the repo root two levels up.
- `design/` and `locales/` are consumed by `termirust-ui-contract`. `design/` also
  holds the Slate design references: `slate-design-system.html` (every token,
  component spec, and the Rust handoff) and `termirust-design-system.html` (the
  interactive TermiRust prototype). `docs/` holds
  guides, ADRs under `decisions/`, and evidence under `completion-evidence/` and
  `engineering-evidence/`; `tools/` holds excluded spike workspaces; `dist/` is
  ignored build output.

## Important architecture

- [crates/termirust-desktop/src/main.rs](crates/termirust-desktop/src/main.rs)
  - Bootstraps GPUI, redirects logs to a file, restores the saved window bounds/display, registers the embedded asset source, and opens the main window.
- [crates/termirust-desktop/src/platform_mac.rs](crates/termirust-desktop/src/platform_mac.rs)
  - macOS window-control interop: disables the OS title-bar drag so the chrome tabs stay usable, and starts native window drags from the chrome's empty area.
- [crates/termirust-desktop/src/assets.rs](crates/termirust-desktop/src/assets.rs)
  - Embedded SVG asset source for the app chrome and custom Phosphor-style icons.
- `crates/termirust-desktop/src/ui/app/` — main application state and UI, split across modules:
  - [mod.rs](crates/termirust-desktop/src/ui/app/mod.rs) — `TermiRustApp` state, event loop, recursive split tree, window-bounds persistence.
  - [chrome.rs](crates/termirust-desktop/src/ui/app/chrome.rs) — top chrome: tab strip, traffic lights, tab context menu.
  - [workspace.rs](crates/termirust-desktop/src/ui/app/workspace.rs) — terminal pane rendering, split layout, SFTP files view.
  - [editor.rs](crates/termirust-desktop/src/ui/app/editor.rs) / [hosts.rs](crates/termirust-desktop/src/ui/app/hosts.rs) / [library.rs](crates/termirust-desktop/src/ui/app/library.rs) — host editor and library.
  - [connect.rs](crates/termirust-desktop/src/ui/app/connect.rs) / [sftp.rs](crates/termirust-desktop/src/ui/app/sftp.rs) / [palette.rs](crates/termirust-desktop/src/ui/app/palette.rs) / [overlay.rs](crates/termirust-desktop/src/ui/app/overlay.rs) / [types.rs](crates/termirust-desktop/src/ui/app/types.rs).
  - [canvas.rs](crates/termirust-desktop/src/ui/app/canvas.rs) — canvas geometry, interaction, terminal and
    agent nodes, links, worktree controls, and orchestration UI.
- `crates/termirust-desktop/src/agents/` — safe process launch, normalized protocols, provider adapters,
  context redaction, worktree ownership, and dependency scheduling.
- [crates/termirust-desktop/src/ui/theme.rs](crates/termirust-desktop/src/ui/theme.rs)
  - App color system and layout constants.
- `crates/termirust-tmux/` — the one GPUI-free tmux integration: binary discovery, bounded
  `list-sessions` parsing, attach arguments, a listing self-check, and
  `shell_integration` (the previewed, conflict-checked startup-file change and its removal).
  The Controller listener's `tmux_sessions.rs` uses it to publish tmux sessions and attach
  through shared in-process Session Hosts running `tmux attach-session -f ignore-size`.
- `crates/termirust-slate/` — Slate, the styled component library the desktop app will move to.
  - Built on `gpui-base` 0.6 (behavior: focus, keyboard, overlays, accessibility) over the
    `gpui-pre` 0.3 snapshots, which coexist in the workspace with the app's `gpui` 0.2.2.
    The desktop app cannot use Slate until it migrates from `gpui` 0.2 / `gpui-component`
    to `gpui-pre` + `gpui-base`.
  - [theme.rs](crates/termirust-slate/src/theme.rs) resolves `DesignTokens` into GPUI colors,
    sizes, type, and shadows per `ThemeChoice`, installs them as a global, and projects them
    onto `gpui_base::Theme` so base inputs share the palette. Components read only from it.
  - [icon.rs](crates/termirust-slate/src/icon.rs) generates the 16-unit stroke icon set and the
    eight status glyph shapes as SVG; serve them with `SlateAssets` (or `with_fallback`).
  - Primitives: `button.rs`, `controls.rs` (Segmented, Toggle, FilterTabs), `input.rs`,
    `kbd.rs`, `status.rs`, `tooltip.rs`. Shell: `shell.rs`. Data views: `data.rs`.
    Overlays: `overlay.rs` (menus, palette, dialogs, toasts, banners). Terminal chrome:
    `terminal.rs`. `split.rs` holds the `SplitNode` tree (four-pane cap, 0.15–0.85 ratios)
    and `SplitPanes`, which draws dividers and edge drop zones.
  - Callbacks follow GPUI's `Fn(&Event, &mut Window, &mut App)` shape so `cx.listener` fits.
  - [examples/gallery.rs](crates/termirust-slate/examples/gallery.rs) renders every
    component and state in a working shell; `SLATE_THEME`, `SLATE_TAB`, `SLATE_OVERLAY`,
    and `SLATE_SCROLL` start it in a given state for screenshots.
- [crates/termirust-desktop/src/terminal.rs](crates/termirust-desktop/src/terminal.rs)
  - VT state wrapper around `vt100`: snapshot generation, scrollback access, selection extraction, bracketed-paste and mouse-mode inspection.
- [crates/termirust-desktop/src/ssh.rs](crates/termirust-desktop/src/ssh.rs)
  - SSH runtime thread and Tokio event loop: shell open, PTY allocation, raw input/output, and remote resize.
- [crates/termirust-desktop/src/local.rs](crates/termirust-desktop/src/local.rs)
  - Local PTY shell sessions (started in the user's home directory).
- [crates/termirust-desktop/src/sftp.rs](crates/termirust-desktop/src/sftp.rs)
  - SFTP runtime backing the remote-files view.
- [crates/termirust-desktop/src/credentials.rs](crates/termirust-desktop/src/credentials.rs)
  - System credential-store (keyring) access for saved passwords.
- [crates/termirust-desktop/src/models.rs](crates/termirust-desktop/src/models.rs)
  - Saved host models, draft parsing, connect-request generation, and persisted window bounds.
- [crates/termirust-desktop/src/storage.rs](crates/termirust-desktop/src/storage.rs)
  - Saved state persistence, TOFU known-host pinning, startup import of local `~/.ssh` identities, and host import from `~/.ssh/config`.

## State model notes

- A `WorkspaceTab` is the top-level unit shown in the chrome bar.
- A workspace's panes are arranged by a recursive `SplitNode` binary tree (`Leaf` / `Split { axis, ratio, a, b }`); dropping a tab on a pane splits that leaf. The cap is `MAX_SPLIT_PANES` (4).
- A `SessionPane` owns one SSH (or local PTY) runtime and one `TerminalState`.
- Split panes are separate SSH sessions to the same host, not a single PTY split.
- Unread tab activity is tracked per workspace and is used for tab badges.
- `SessionLogEntry` records connect/disconnect/error events with timestamps; session logs persist in `state.json` (capped at 200) and survive restarts. Each `SessionPane` carries a `log_id` linking it to its entry.
- `QuickConnect::parse` extracts `user@host:port` from search bar input.
- The window frame and its display id are persisted in `state.json` and reapplied on the next launch.

## Build and run

```bash
cargo fmt
cargo check
cargo run            # debug build; use --release for performance testing
cargo test --workspace --all-targets --locked   # everything, as CI runs it
cargo run -p termirust-slate --example gallery  # Slate component gallery
cargo run -p termirust-ui-contract --bin generate-tokens  # after editing design/tokens.toml
```

The Docker-backed SSH/SFTP tests bind-mount files from `tests/fixtures/`, so they need a
local Docker daemon; with `DOCKER_HOST` pointing at a remote machine the mounts resolve on
that machine and the fixtures fail to start.

On macOS, GPUI may need access to the system shader cache during first compile/run.

Structured diagnostics are stored under `<data dir>/termirust/diagnostics` with
bounded rotation and retention. See [docs/diagnostics.md](docs/diagnostics.md).

## UI behavior details

- Clicking a host card loads it into the editor panel.
- Connecting opens a new workspace tab; the tab strip auto-scrolls to keep the active tab visible.
- Dragging a workspace tab reorders tabs; dropping onto a tab inserts before it; dropping in the empty strip after the last tab moves the tab to the end.
- Dropping a tab onto a terminal pane splits that pane.
- Double-clicking the empty chrome area opens a new local terminal.
- Active workspace search is local to the active pane; search and unread badges are per workspace tab.

## Known implementation limits

- Mouse reporting is practical, not exhaustive protocol coverage.
- Search is plain substring search over terminal text, not regex.
- The `Keychain` imports keys from `~/.ssh` and allows picking files from disk, but does not generate keys.
- SSH config hosts are imported at startup (shown with an `SSH Config` badge) and runtime-synced, not written back into the app state file.
- Quick connect uses the first available SSH key; for password-only auth, use the host editor form.
- The terminal re-renders the whole app on any output and rebuilds a full snapshot per frame; the performance backlog is tracked in GitHub issue #2.
