# Cargo runner for macOS. `cargo build` gives each binary an ad-hoc signature whose
# identifier changes with every build, so the Keychain treats each rebuild as a new app
# and asks for access again. Before running the desktop app this re-signs it with a
# stable identifier and a local code-signing identity, so "Always Allow" survives
# rebuilds. Every other binary (tests, examples, other crates) runs unchanged.
#
# The identity is $TERMIRUST_CODESIGN_IDENTITY, or else the first "Apple Development"
# identity in the login keychain. With neither, the binary runs as built.
