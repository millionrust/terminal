# Builds and tests the Linux halves of Remote Screens, which cannot be built on macOS at all:
# the capture backend needs libpipewire, the input backend needs Linux headers to link, and the
# desktop crate cannot be cross-compiled from a Mac because ring's build script wants a C
# toolchain for the target.
#
#   scripts/verify/linux-screens.sh [cargo subcommand] [args...]
#   scripts/verify/linux-screens.sh --desktop [cargo subcommand] [args...]
#
# Defaults to `test --all-targets`; `clippy --all-targets` is the other one worth running.
#
# `--desktop` adds the desktop crate, which is where the Linux screen-sharing flow lives -- the
# portal grant and the fan-out that feeds every watcher from one stream. It costs a much larger
# image and a five-minute build, so it is not the default, but it is the only way to type-check
# that code anywhere.
#
# Three things about how this reaches Linux are worth knowing before changing it.
#
# The sources are streamed in as a tar rather than bind-mounted. DOCKER_HOST is often a daemon on
# another machine, and a bind mount would name paths on *that* machine, so a mount silently
# resolves to nothing rather than failing. The tar always arrives.
#
# Only the screen crates are sent, with a workspace manifest written inside the container. Sending
# the whole repository would drag in every other crate's dependencies for no benefit; this only
# has to prove these crates compile and their tests pass on Linux.
#
# What this can and cannot establish is worth being exact about. It runs the parts that are pure
# logic -- keymaps, stride unpacking, the format offered to PipeWire -- which is real coverage
# that a cross-compile check alone does not give. It cannot establish anything that needs a
# desktop: no compositor answers the portal, and /dev/uinput is not there.
#
# Skips itself when no daemon answers, the way the other Docker-backed checks here do.
