# Spike 0.2: what capture costs under the three workloads Remote Screens is sized for.
#
# RS2 measured an uncontrolled screen -- "this development session, which updates continuously" --
# which answered the architectural question (macOS attaches no dirty rectangles) but not the sizing
# one. The plan's targets are per workload, so the measurement has to be per workload too.
#
# Each workload is driven in this terminal, so it must be the visible, frontmost window, the screen
# must be awake and unlocked, and Screen Recording must be allowed for this terminal. Nothing is
# recorded to disk: capture_stats prints counts and rates and keeps no pixels.
#
#   scripts/bench/capture-workloads.sh [seconds] [scale] [video-file]
#
# `video-file` is optional. Without it the video row is a synthetic full-screen animation, which
# has the capture characteristic that matters (a large area changing every frame) but is not a real
# decoded video, and the output says so. With it, the file is opened in the default player.
