# Shape one port's traffic into one of section 7's four network profiles, using the traffic shaper
# macOS already has (dummynet, driven through dnctl and pfctl). No downloads, no GUI.
#
#   sudo scripts/bench/condition-link.sh up 3 --port 51820
#   sudo scripts/bench/condition-link.sh status
#   sudo scripts/bench/condition-link.sh down
#
# Why a port and not the whole machine: Network Link Conditioner shapes every interface, and in this
# project the screen *host* runs on the same Mac as the thing being measured. Throttling the Mac
# throttles the host too, so the picture is degraded at both ends and the number means nothing. Pf
# can match a port, so only the screen session is shaped and everything else -- including whatever
# is on screen being captured -- runs at full speed.
#
# Find the port with the app running:
#   lsof -nP -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN | grep -i termirust
#
# SAFETY. These rules outlive the shell that made them. The script therefore:
#   - keeps everything in a named anchor (`termirust-cond`), so teardown cannot touch other rules;
#   - installs an automatic revert after --ttl seconds (default 3600) in case the session ends badly;
#   - refuses to configure a second profile over a live one without an explicit `down` first.
# If anything goes wrong, `sudo scripts/bench/condition-link.sh down` is always safe to run, and
# `sudo pfctl -a termirust-cond -F all && sudo dnctl -q flush` is the manual escape hatch.
