//! Whether a throughput budget is enforced here, or only measured.

//! A p95 threshold asserted on a shared CI runner measures the runner, not this code. The hosted

//! 1.39 s against 250 ms — with nothing about the code under them changed, because it is a slow
//! two-core machine running an anti-virus scanner over every file the build touches.

//! So every benchmark still runs everywhere and still prints its p50 and p95, which keeps a crash,

//! `TERMIRUST_PERF_BUDGETS=1` enforces budgets anyway, for a dedicated machine that sets `CI`;
//! `TERMIRUST_PERF_BUDGETS=0` relaxes them on a laptop that is busy doing something else.
