//! The QUIC route, over iroh.
//!
//! Section 5.3 of the plan chose QUIC for Stage B, and iroh for the parts QUIC does not do by
//! itself: finding a peer by key rather than by address, punching through NAT, and falling back to
//! a relay when it cannot. What QUIC brings is the three things this codec has wanted since the
//! transport seam was drawn — reliable ordered streams for tile batches, unreliable datagrams for
//! video, and a connection that survives the address underneath it changing.
//!
//! **Behind the `iroh` feature, and off by default.** A host serving tiles over the Controller
//! channel has no use for a QUIC stack, a relay client and a Tokio runtime, and Stage A is the
//! configuration that ships today. Everything above this module talks to [`Transport`], so a
//! build without the feature is missing a route rather than missing a capability.
//!
//! **Built ahead of the 0.4 device spike, by the owner's decision on 2026-09-18.** That spike is a
//! phone on cellular, which no amount of local testing substitutes for. Writing this against the
//! seam is what makes a no-go cost a transport rather than a milestone: nothing in the session
//! knows iroh exists.
//!
//! ## Why each class gets what it gets
//!
//! - [`Class::Control`] rides a bidirectional stream. It carries subscriptions, acknowledgements,
//!   input and capability changes: small, ordered, and every one of them matters.
//! - [`Class::Tiles`] rides its own unidirectional stream, so a large batch cannot head-of-line
//!   block an acknowledgement travelling the other way. A tile batch is a difference from the last
//!   picture, so this stream must be reliable — losing one leaves the screen wrong for ever.
//! - [`Class::Video`] rides datagrams. It is the only class built to survive loss, with long-term
//!   references to recover from it and parity to avoid needing to, and the only one for which
//!   waiting for a retransmission is worse than missing a frame.
