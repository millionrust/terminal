//! Injecting input on Linux, through `uinput`.
//!
//! `uinput` creates a virtual input device in the kernel. Events written to it arrive in whatever
//! is running the session — X11, a Wayland compositor, a bare console — as if a keyboard and
//! mouse had been plugged in, which is why it works the same under all of them when the X11 and
//! Wayland routes do not.
//!
//! **Text is the one thing this cannot do.** A `uinput` device reports key positions; the
//! compositor's keymap turns those into characters, and nothing here can reach that keymap. So
//! there is no way to inject an `é` or an emoji the way `KEYEVENTF_UNICODE` does on Windows or a
//! Unicode keyboard event does on macOS. Typing normal keys works, which is most of what a remote
//! screen needs; pasted text and accented characters return [`InputError::UnmappedKey`] rather
//! than silently arriving as the wrong letters. Doing better means uploading a custom XKB keymap
//! with the virtual device, which is a larger piece of work than this one.
//!
//! **Permission.** `/dev/uinput` is usually root-only. A desktop install that wants this should
//! ship a udev rule granting the `input` group access rather than running the host as root; the
//! error says so rather than leaving a blank refusal.
