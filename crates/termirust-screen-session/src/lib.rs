//! Host and viewer state machines for a Remote Screens session.
//!
//! Neither side performs I/O. The host feeds received messages and captured frames in and takes
//! messages out; the viewer does the same with batches and user actions. The caller moves the
//! messages over a transport with `termirust-screen-protocol` framing, authenticates the peer, and
//! decides who holds control. See `docs/remote-screens-implementation-plan.md`, sections 4.1–4.7.
