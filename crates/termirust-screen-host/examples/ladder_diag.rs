//! Traces what the rate estimator and the ladder do in one cell of the network matrix.
//!
//! `cargo run -p termirust-screen-host --release --example ladder_diag -- [profile] [workload]`
//!
//! `profile` is 0 to 3 across section 7's four profiles, worst last; `workload` is typing,
//! scrolling or video. Defaults to the worst profile with video, which is the cell most likely to
//! be interesting.
//!
//! Written because a matrix that only reports a final rung cannot tell you *why* it is that rung.
//! The first thing this found was the harness's own fault rather than the ladder's: with a link
//! that handed each message over at a single instant there was no arrival spread to time, the
//! estimate stayed `None` for whole runs, and the ladder never moved because it was never told
//! anything.
