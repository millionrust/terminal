//! Some capture APIs composite the pointer for you and some hand it over separately. Desktop
//! Duplication is the second kind: the desktop image has no pointer in it at all, and the shape

//! so something has to draw it.
//!
//! This module is deliberately free of platform types. The three shapes Windows can send are a
//! fiddly little format with two genuinely surprising rules in it, and keeping the blending here
//! means it can be tested on every platform rather than only on the one machine that can run it.
